h2. Titleist

_**Patch 3.3 Information Unfortunately because some people had scripts and mods that cycled titles every second, creating too much network traffic, etc., Blizzard locked us out of the SetCurrentTitle() funciton unless it is triggered by a user action such as a button click or keybind. For the time being, until I can work out another alternative, this addon is out of commission.**_

Titleist is a simple solution to a simple problem. Everyone is now collecting achievements and the titles that go with them. But which title should you display?

Don't fret, just let Titleist take care of it for you.

Every 5 minutes, Titleist will change your title randomly. The new title will be printed to your default chat frame.  Just install and go. No configuration required.

h2. Changing the timer

I've had a number of feature requests for a configurable timer length. Rather than double the amount of code in the addon to enable a configuration option, I will instead show you how to edit the LUA file to change the timer.

* Open Titlelist.lua in any text editor
* After the initial comment block, there is a line that looks like this:

bq. @-- Change this if you don't like the delay@
@local delay = 300 --seconds@

* Change that number to the number of seconds you would like between title changes. The value is in seconds.
* Save the file and if you are still in game, reload UI
